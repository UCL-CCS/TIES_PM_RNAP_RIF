# Output Files

This directory contains the original simulation outputs for the mutation **V170F**, provided as an example to illustrate the file and folder structure used in the TIES-PM workflow.

---

## Structure Description

- The example includes both `com/` (complex) and `prot/` (apo protein) directories.
- Each of these directories contains **13 lambda windows**, named `LAMBDA_0.0/` through `LAMBDA_1.0/`.
- Within each lambda window, there are **5 replicas**, named `rep1/` through `rep5/`.
- Each replica contains the output files from a single molecular dynamics simulation.
